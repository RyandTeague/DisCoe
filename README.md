Website's purpose is to inform potential customers about a music festival happening in Glencoe and currently direct them to sign onto the mailing list for when tickets go on sale. User's will be able to find information about the festival and navigate between pages easily.

The main aim for this project was to create a responsive website using CSS and HTML.
